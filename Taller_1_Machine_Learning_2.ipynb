        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will explore clustering techniques by implementing the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) from scratch and applying it to two datasets. You will also implement the Elbow and Silhouette methods in combination with K-Means or GMM to evaluate the optimal number of clusters based on several performance metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment is divided into two tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implementing the Gaussian Mixture Model and evaluating clustering performance using the Rand Index.\n",
        "2. Evaluating clustering quality and the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method, Silhouette analysis, and clustering metrics.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this task, you are required to implement the GMM algorithm from scratch and apply it to the FIFA 23 Players Dataset and the EastWestAirlines Dataset for clustering. You should evaluate the performance of your clustering results using both qualitative and quantitative measures.\n",

        "## Datasets\n",
        "\n",
        "- FIFA 23 Players Dataset: This dataset contains detailed attributes of professional soccer players. The objective is to cluster players based on their skills and playing styles. Relevant features for clustering include:\n",
        "- Age\n",
        "- Overall rating (general skill level)\n",
        "- Potential (maximum projected skill level)\n",
        "- Value (market price in €)\n",
        "- Wage (weekly salary)\n",
        "- Shooting, Passing, Dribbling (technical abilities)\n",
        "- Defending, Physicality (defensive capabilities)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can download the dataset from Kaggle: FIFA 23 Dataset - Kaggle.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## Tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implement the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm from scratch. Do not use libraries like scikit-learn's GMM implementation for this part.\n",
        "2. Fit the GMM to both datasets (FIFA 23 Players and EastWestAirlines) and perform clustering.\n",
        "3. Evaluate your clustering results using the following methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Rand Index: Calculate the Rand Index to compare your clustering results against meaningful labels (e.g., player positions). Read more about the Rand Index here: Rand Index - Wikipedia.\n",
        "- Qualitative Evaluation: For both datasets, visualize and describe the resulting clusters (e.g., scatter plots, pair plots, or other visualizations that highlight the formed groups). For visualizations in Python, you may refer to this guide: Seaborn Visualization Library.\n",
